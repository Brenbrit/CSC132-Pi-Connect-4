Description here.

-=Numpy and Pygame are required for this project=-

 ```pip install numpy pygame```

We also reccommend to run this line on your pi.
It installs a program that hides your cursor after a few seconds of inactivity.
This is not necessary, but it looks nicer this way.

```sudo apt-get install unclutter```
