# pi-connect-4
Description here.

-=The libraries required for this game are=-
 * NUMPY and PYGAME

We also reccommend to run this line on your pi. 
It installs a program that hides your cursor after a few seconds of inactivity.
This is not necessary, but it looks nicer this way.
* sudo apt-get install unclutter
